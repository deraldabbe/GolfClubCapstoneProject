User Interface:

Develop a basic user interface with a form to input the desired distance and select the skill level (beginner, amateur, pro).
Include a button to trigger the club recommendation process.
Backend Functionality:

Implement the backend logic to calculate club recommendations based on the provided distance and skill level.
Create a simple algorithm that suggests clubs based on predefined ranges of distances for each skill level.
Club Data:

Predefine a limited set of golf club data including club types, average distances, and recommended skill levels.
Store the club data in a data structure such as an array or JSON file.
Club Recommendation:

Develop the logic to match the desired distance and skill level with the appropriate club recommendation.
Use the predefined club data to generate a recommendation based on the user's input.
Frontend-Backend Interaction:

Set up the communication between the frontend and backend using HTTP requests.
Send the user's input (distance, skill level) from the frontend to the backend for club recommendation processing.
Receive the club recommendation from the backend and display it to the user.
Basic Styling:

Apply basic styling using CSS to make the user interface visually appealing and user-friendly.
Focus on a clean and intuitive design without extensive customization.
Testing and Refinement:

Test the MVP thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly and provides accurate club recommendations based on the inputs.
Gather user feedback and iterate on the app based on their suggestions and needs.
Refine the features, performance, and user experience based on the feedback received.


Server Communication:
Set up a server using a framework like Express.js (Node.js) to handle incoming requests from the front end.
Define an API endpoint that the front end can communicate with to send data and receive responses.
Use a library like Axios in the front end to make HTTP requests to the server and handle the responses.

Interactivity:
Create an interactive front end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Implement input fields for distance and skill level selection, along with a submit button to trigger the club recommendation process.
Add event listeners to capture user interactions and handle the corresponding actions, such as validating input and making the API request.

Custom Styling:
Apply custom styling to the front end to enhance the visual appeal and user experience.
Use CSS to customize the appearance of my app.
Design visually appealing components, layouts, and typography that align with my app's branding and theme.


Front-end Workflow:

User visits the app and sees the landing page with custom styling.
User interacts with the input fields (distance and skill level) and clicks the submit button.
JavaScript code captures the input values and validates them.
JavaScript code makes an HTTP request to the server using Axios, sending the input values.
The server receives the request, processes the data, and generates a club recommendation.
The server sends the club recommendation as a response to the front end.
JavaScript code in the front end receives the response and updates the user interface to display the club recommendation with custom styling.
The user can continue interacting with the app, adjusting input values, and making new requests.
